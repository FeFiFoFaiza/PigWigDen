Given up on birds. Will do face first then format to birds if I can.

Liberties I've taken:
    - Using pre grayed out and cropped face photos
    - Using some pre written functions like mean
    - Might end up using ML who knows



face 
    - facial recognition
        - eigen faces

    - facial verification
        - 1:1 matching

bird 
    - amazon
    - First edge detect a bird (Use grayscale image, get brightness of each pixel, laplacian)
    - try to identify a bird
    - try different color birds
    - species(?)

Sincerity is key. Don't make it transactional. Connect with professors early. Go office hours
