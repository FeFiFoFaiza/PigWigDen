MUST HAVE OPENCV TO WORK

## Outputs
cannyEdgeDetection.py -> image of the edges of Bird_Demo.jpg  
edgeDetection.py -> detects edges but is built in method  
faceEigenVals.py -> Mean Face and negatives of Eigenfaces (must make not negative)  
notherAttempt.py -> Trying to also get eigenfaces but different method (weighted and with ML)  


To do list:
- [X] Canny Edge Algo
- [X] Find EigenVecs
- [ ] Find EigenFaces
- [ ] Make method to compute Euclidean Distance to detect faces outside of DB
- [ ] Implement Canny Edge to detect faces without cropping (may have to use Haar XML)
- [ ] BIRDS????
